# Employee Tracker 

For this project, I was to create a MySQL database a user could query to search through employee data, as well as updata employee data.

## Video Demo

TBA

## Criteria 

I was to create a command application that you could navigate from an easy to read menu. I had to allow the user to view all job departments, positions, and individual employees. Additionally, I was to allowo the user to be able to add new departments, positions, and employees, as well as update employee roles. 

## Known Issues

One must restart and rerun the program for each individual query. 

## Future Development Notes

Allow database to be accessed without rerunning the application

Improve schema, including time at company and manager tagging 

Improve query options, allowing to search more specifically to accomidate larger companies / employee pools.
